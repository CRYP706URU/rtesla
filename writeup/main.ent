macro:->Gus
Gutoski
and
Chris
Peikert
discovered
a
mistake
in
the
tight
security
reduction
from
the
R-LWE
problem
to
TESLA
presented
in
the
referenced
paper.
The
mistake,
however,
does
not
yet
lead
to
any
attack
against
TESLA.
The
non-tight
security
reduction
given
by
Bai
and
Galbraith
still
holds.
